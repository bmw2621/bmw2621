![Me](https://github.com/bmw2621/portfolio/blob/master/src/images/me2.svg)

I am a developer with a focus on javascript, python and java, utilizing their ecosystems for product development, Big Data and and general software engineering practices. I am an 11 year veteran of the US Army who learned frontend development from #VetsWhoCode, and am passionate about teaching others, helping them to pursue their dream and learn to code. I host the #VetsWhoCode Podcast, and want to help others any way I can.
